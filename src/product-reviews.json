      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Compared to the XYZ model, these headphones outperform in battery life, offering 30 hours versus XYZ’s 20 hours, which means less frequent charging. While both provide strong noise cancellation, this model delivers a richer and more balanced sound profile, particularly in bass response. The comfort level is comparable, though the new headphones feature softer ear cushions. However, XYZ has a slightly more compact design, which might appeal to travelers. Overall, the new headphones provide better value for users prioritizing battery longevity and sound quality."
