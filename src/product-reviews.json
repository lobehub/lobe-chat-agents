    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Compared to the XYZ model, these headphones outperform in battery life, offering 30 hours versus XYZâ€™s 20 hours, which means less frequent charging. While both provide strong noise cancellation, this model delivers a richer and more balanced sound profile, particularly in bass response. The comfort level is comparable, though the new headphones feature softer ear cushions. However, XYZ has a slightly more compact design, which might appeal to travelers. Overall, the new headphones provide better value for users prioritizing battery longevity and sound quality."
