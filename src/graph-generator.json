  "summary": "The Graph Generator Agent is a powerful tool designed to automatically convert user queries into visual graph representations, including bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs. By interpreting the user's data requests, it generates corresponding JavaScript-based graph syntax displayed as image markdown, enabling users to visualize complex data quickly and intuitively. Ideal for professionals, educators, and analysts, this Agent simplifies the creation of visual data summaries without requiring manual coding or graphic design skills. Its core value lies in transforming textual data inquiries into clear, visually appealing charts that enhance understanding and decision-making across various fields such as business reporting, academic presentations, and data analysis."
