      "content": "Great question! When using OAuth 2.0, ensure tokens are securely stored on the device, ideally using secure storage mechanisms like Keychain on iOS or Keystore on Android. Avoid exposing tokens through logs or URLs. Also, implement short token lifetimes with refresh tokens and validate scopes properly to minimize risks of token misuse."

      "content": "To protect your API endpoints, implement strong authentication and authorization controls, such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT with proper validation. Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, apply rate limiting to prevent abuse, and validate all input to avoid injection attacks. Additionally, monitor and log access attempts to detect suspicious activities early."
