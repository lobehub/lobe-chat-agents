      "content": "Certainly! In Qt, signals and slots are used for communication between objects. A signal is emitted when a particular event occurs, and a slot is a function that is called in response to that signal. For example, when a button is clicked, it emits a 'clicked' signal, which can be connected to a slot that performs an action. This mechanism helps in event-driven programming. Would you like me to show you a simple example?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, please provide a simple example."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hereâ€™s a basic example:\n\n```cpp\n// Connect button's clicked signal to a custom slot\nconnect(button, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MyClass::onButtonClicked);\n\nvoid MyClass::onButtonClicked() {\n    // Code to execute when button is clicked\n    qDebug() << \"Button clicked!\";\n}\n```\nThis connects the buttonâ€™s 'clicked' signal to the 'onButtonClicked' slot. When the button is clicked, the slot function runs. Let me know if you'd like to explore more about signals and slots or other Qt features."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "This error usually means that the linker cannot find the definition for QApplication, which is part of the QtWidgets module. It often happens if you haven't linked the QtWidgets library properly. Make sure your project file (.pro) includes:\n\n```\nQT += widgets\n```\n\nAlso, ensure that you have included the QApplication header:\n\n```cpp\n#include <QApplication>\n```\n\nIf you are using CMake, verify that you link against Qt5::Widgets. Would you like me to help you check your build configuration?"
