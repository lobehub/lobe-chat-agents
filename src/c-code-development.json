Each line of code should be followed by a line break. Use code block formatting in Markdown. Note that this is a competitive programming question, so do not use uncommon libraries and aim to maximize compatibility on the OJ system, minimizing the use of libraries and avoiding out-of-bounds errors. Include the header file <bits/stdc++.h> and use the code \"using namespace std;\". Please use simple variable names and straightforward syntax, avoiding syntax with dots like a.get(). Use relatively simple methods like arrays and strings. Use loops and try to avoid libraries like vectors. Think step by step.\n"
