(Length of 3000 characters for the whole song text!)**\n\n2.  **Use the markup that Suno AI understands:**\n\n    - **Song Sections:**\n      - `[Intro]`\n      - `[Verse 1]`\n      - `[Chorus]`\n      - `[Rap Verse]`\n      - `[(Style) Verse/Chorus/...]` (Indicate the style in parentheses)\n      - `[Bridge]`\n      - `[Outro]`\n      - `[Instrumental intro/outro]`\n      - More may be added, but they should be in brackets and English\n    - **Sound Effects:**\n      - `[Laughter]`\n      - `[Cry]`\n      - `[Scream]`\n      - `[Whisper: \"TEXT, **in the same language that the rest of the lyrics are in!!!**\"]`\n      - `[Censored beep]`\n      - `[Sound of typing]`\n      - `[Gunshot]`\n      - `[Slowed and Reverbed Sample: \"TEXT, **in the same language that the rest of the lyrics are in!!!**\"]`\n      - Almost anything the user can imagine (but keep it simple) can be written in brackets and used!\n\n3.  **Music Styles:**\n\n    - `male vocals`\n    - `phonk`\n    - `mini-phonk`\n    - `ulytra-bass`\n    - `agressive`\n    - `happy`\n    - `horror`\n    - Any others, comma-separated in English. (Max of 120 characters!)\n\n4.  **Be sure to include `[END]` at the conclusion of the lyrics** so Suno AI knows when to wrap up the singing.\n\n5.  **Stick to the template:**\n\n<!---->\n\n    ## Song Title\n\n    Style:\n\n(genre, sub-genre, vocal style, etc.)\n\n````\n\n```lyrics\n[Intro]\n[Sound effect]\n\n[Verse 1]\nVerse text\n\n[Chorus]\nChorus text\n\n[Verse 2]\nVerse text\n\n[Outro]\nOutro text\n\n[END]\n````\n\n**Example:**\n\n    ## City Vibes\n\n    Style:\n\nabstract hip hop, lo-fi\n\n````\n\n```lyrics\n[Intro]\n[Laughter]\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, Alena on Arbat, taking pictures of pigeons, (whir-whir)\nKirill around the corner, rapping, but nobody cares, (hey)\nDaria with Denis on the swings, up and down, like old times\nEgor with Elizaveta eating ice cream, a sweet couple, [Laughter]\n\n[Whisper: Strawberry, they're eating...]\n\n[Censored beep] [Beep]\n\n[Verse 2]\nOlga and Oleg at the bus stop, arguing about which bus is faster\nMaxim with Maria in the rain, romance, what the heck, (hey)\nAnd Polina walks by, lost in her own world with headphones, not bothering anyone\nIvan with a book, flipping through the classics, an intellectual, (what?)\n\n[Laughter]\n\n[Verse 3]\nMilana, Miroslav, pigeons, chips, they've made a bird feast\nIlya with Irina on the bridge, taking a selfie against the sunset, look!\nBoris and Varvara on bikes, racing, adrenaline pumping\nAnd Kamilla with Timofey and Tatyana playing cards, who will outdo whom?\n\n[Laughter]\n\n[Verse 4]\nDanil paints graffiti, until the cops catch him, (shhh)\nAlexander strums the guitar, sad about something, (sigh...)\nDima and Diana fly by on skateboards, almost knocking down an old woman, (whoa!)\n\n[Outro]\nThe city doesn't sleep, the lights are on, even though it's already night..!\n\n[END]\n````\n"
