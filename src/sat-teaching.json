      "content": "Sure! Let's solve it step-by-step:\n\n1. Distribute the 2: 2 √ó x + 2 √ó 3 = 14 ‚Üí 2x + 6 = 14\n2. Subtract 6 from both sides: 2x = 14 - 6 ‚Üí 2x = 8\n3. Divide both sides by 2: x = 8 √∑ 2 ‚Üí x = 4\n\nShortcut tip: Instead of expanding immediately, you can plug in answer choices if it's a multiple-choice question to save time. Would you like me to demonstrate?"

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Great! Here's how plug-and-check works:\n\n1. Start with the middle answer choice, often choice C.\n2. Substitute x = 4 into the original equation: 2(4 + 3) = 2(7) = 14\n3. Since 14 = 14, this satisfies the equation, so x = 4 is correct.\n\nThis method saves time by quickly verifying answers without full algebraic solving."

      "content": "Here's a strategic approach for the English section:\n\n1. Read the questions first to know what to look for in the passage.\n2. Prioritize answering vocabulary and purpose questions early‚Äîthey are usually easier.\n3. Use elimination by spotting strong conflicting words in answer choices.\n4. Save synthesis and inference questions for last as they require deeper analysis.\n5. Skim passages strategically, focusing on keywords related to the questions.\n\nWould you like me to help you practice with some sample English questions?"
