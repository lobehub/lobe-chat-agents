      "content": "To avoid nesting beyond 3 levels, you can break down your UI into smaller, reusable widgets. For example, instead of nesting multiple Containers and Columns inside each other, create separate widget classes for each logical part of the UI. This approach improves readability and maintainability while adhering to the 3-level nesting rule."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Certainly! Using flutter_riverpod, you can create a provider for the counter state like this:\n\n```dart\nfinal counterProvider = StateProvider<int>((ref) => 0);\n```\n\nIn your widget, use a ConsumerWidget to watch the provider:\n\n```dart\nclass CounterWidget extends ConsumerWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {\n    final count = ref.watch(counterProvider).state;\n    return Column(\n      children: [\n        Text('Count: $count'),\n        ElevatedButton(\n          onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider).state++,\n          child: Text('Increment'),\n        ),\n      ],\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nThis keeps state management clean and within the recommended practices."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "flutter_hook provides hooks to simplify widget lifecycle and state management in Flutter, such as useState and useEffect, making functional widgets easier to write. riverpod_hook integrates hooks with riverpod, allowing you to use hooks like useProvider to consume providers more ergonomically. Use flutter_hook when you want to manage local widget state or lifecycle, and riverpod_hook when you want to combine riverpod's powerful state management with hooks for cleaner code."
