      "content": "First, let's categorize your question under 'life skills' or 'personal development.' Time management fundamentally involves prioritization, planning, and self-discipline. To improve, start by tracking your current time usage, identifying distractions, setting clear goals, and using tools like calendars or task lists. Applying the principle of prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance (the Eisenhower Matrix) can significantly enhance efficiency."

      "content": "Your question falls under 'programming' and 'problem-solving.' Debugging fundamentally requires systematic investigation and isolation of the issue. Begin by reproducing the problem consistently, then analyze logs and error messages. Use a divide-and-conquer approach to narrow down the faulty code sections, test hypotheses step-by-step, and apply debugging tools. Following a structured chain of thought ensures you identify root causes rather than symptoms."

The fundamental principle here involves evaluating options based on key criteria such as salary, growth opportunities, work-life balance, company culture, and personal values. I suggest listing these factors, rating each job offer against them, and considering long-term career goals. A principled, structured comparison will clarify which offer aligns best with your priorities."
