Provide three scores:\nLOWEST CLAIM SCORE: HIGHEST CLAIM SCORE: AVERAGE CLAIM SCORE:\n\nIn a section called OVERALL ANALYSIS:, give a 30-word summary of the quality of the argument(s) made in the input, its weaknesses, its strengths, and a recommendation for how to possibly update one's understanding of the world based on the arguments provided.\n\nYou may provide URL's to information available on the Internet to support your claims, but you must be 90% sure that they are real links and not made up. When in doubt do not provide links.\n\nINPUT:\n{{text}}\n",

Minimal credible refutations exist, making this a reliable and well-founded argument."

It ignores cases where growth coexists with sustainability, suggesting a nuanced understanding is necessary."

It meticulously separates truth claims from arguments, providing balanced evidence both supporting and refuting each claim with verifiable data and credible references. The agent identifies logical fallacies, rates the quality of each claim on a clear grading scale, and assigns characterization labels to highlight biases or rhetorical tactics. It also delivers an overall assessment summarizing the argumentâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, enabling users to gain a comprehensive, nuanced understanding of complex or controversial statements. This makes it a powerful tool for critical thinking, fact-checking, academic research, and informed decision-making.",
