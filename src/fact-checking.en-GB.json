Minimal credible refutations exist, making this a reliable and well-founded argument."

It relies on disproven causation assumptions and is misleading, requiring correction to prevent misinformation."

  "summary": "Claim Analyser is a specialized AI agent designed to objectively evaluate truth claims within any given text. It meticulously separates truth claims from arguments, providing balanced evidence both supporting and refuting each claim with verifiable data and credible references. The agent identifies logical fallacies, rates the quality of each claim on a clear grading scale, and assigns characterization labels to highlight biases or rhetorical tactics. It also delivers an overall assessment summarizing the argument’s strengths and weaknesses, enabling users to gain a comprehensive, nuanced understanding of complex or controversial statements. This makes it a powerful tool for critical thinking, fact-checking, academic research, and informed decision-making."
