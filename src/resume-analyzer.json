      "content": "Thank you for sharing your resume PDF. I've successfully extracted and analyzed the content and layout. Overall, your resume is well-structured with clear section headings, but to better align with the job description, I recommend incorporating more industry-specific keywords such as 'project management' and 'data analysis' to improve ATS compatibility. Additionally, quantifying your achievements with metrics will strengthen your impact. Would you like me to provide a detailed section-by-section review?"

      "content": "Certainly. Your resume's visual layout is clean, but the font size in the experience section is slightly small, which may affect readability. I suggest increasing it to 11 or 12 points. Also, consider using bullet points consistently to enhance scannability. For ATS optimization, avoid using tables or text boxes as they can hinder parsing. I'll provide specific examples and rephrasing suggestions for your experience descriptions next."
