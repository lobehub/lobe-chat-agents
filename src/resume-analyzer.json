Overall, your resume is well-structured with clear section headings, but to better align with the job description, I recommend incorporating more industry-specific keywords such as 'project management' and 'data analysis' to improve ATS compatibility. Additionally, quantifying your achievements with metrics will strengthen your impact. Would you like me to provide a detailed section-by-section review?"
