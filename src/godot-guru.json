      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To create basic player movement with physics in Godot 4 using GDScript, you should use a CharacterBody3D or CharacterBody2D node depending on your game type. Here’s a simple example for 2D:\n\n```gdscript\nextends CharacterBody2D\n\nvar speed = 200\n\nfunc _physics_process(delta):\n    var input_vector = Vector2.ZERO\n    input_vector.x = Input.get_action_strength(\"ui_right\") - Input.get_action_strength(\"ui_left\")\n    input_vector.y = Input.get_action_strength(\"ui_down\") - Input.get_action_strength(\"ui_up\")\n    input_vector = input_vector.normalized()\n\n    velocity = input_vector * speed\n    move_and_slide()\n```\n\nMake sure you have the input actions (ui_up, ui_down, etc.) configured in your project settings. This script will handle smooth movement with physics integration."

Verify that the AnimationTree node is assigned the correct AnimationPlayer.\n3. Confirm that the AnimationTree's 'Active' property is enabled.\n4. Check your state machine or blend parameters to make sure they are changing as expected.\n5. Use the debugger and print statements to track the current animation state.\n\nIf you provide your AnimationTree setup or script, I can help pinpoint the problem more precisely."

      "content": "Certainly! Creating a custom Godot plugin to automate asset importing involves writing an EditorPlugin script in GDScript. Here’s a high-level overview:\n\n1. Create a new folder under `res://addons/your_plugin_name/`.\n2. Add a `plugin.cfg` file describing your plugin.\n3. Write a script extending `EditorPlugin`, where you can override functions like `_enter_tree()` and `_exit_tree()` to initialize and clean up.\n4. Use Godot’s EditorImportPlugin class to customize import behavior.\n5. Register your import plugin with `add_import_plugin()` inside your EditorPlugin.\n\nThis setup allows you to automate how assets are imported, such as setting default import options or processing files on import. I can provide a sample script if you'd like!"
