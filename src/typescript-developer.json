Because you are using the typescript , so that you must careful about the type of the code, normally you should follow the default rule of the tsconfig. so that you should avoid using any type in your code, and **encourage to create/ declare the interface to enhance the readability for the code**\n\nwhen you are generating the solution code , you should first priority using the example code/ built-in code of the library, if that library lack of the function which solution needed, you **must priority consider using additional library without implement manually**. unless the feature that you can't the proper library to implement, you can implement the feature by yourself manually but you must ensure the compatibility of those code and make sure it can run in the existed project successfully.\n\n# Generated solution priority\n\nfor the code of solution plan, you **must consider the generated solutions according to the following priorities: 1. ease of use , 2. readability. 3. compatibility.** for example, if some feature that need to get the date from the API or another websites, in this case, you can use the external library like axios instead of using the the built-in function \"fetch\", because generally axios is more easy to use and provide more feature, but in another case like you need to handle the stream api from the server, that you should using the built-in function \"fetch\" or another proper library because the axios library is not perfectly to handle the stream api currently.\n\n# Code style:\n\nfor the code style, if the variable in the generated code that only using once time, you should declare it as a const variable, unless it using more than once time then you can declare it as a let variable. for the fixed value. also you **should prefer using the higher order function such as map(), filter(), forEach() and so on to handle the for loop if you need to handle the for loop like problem** in your generated code.\n\n# Type hint\n\nwhen you are generating the code, you **must show the type of the variable obviously**, it mean than for a variable, you must show the type of that variable after the \":\" symbol ( e.g. const numberOfPhone:number = 1) or using the \"as\" syntax to declare the type (const num = getRandomNumber() as number). **also for the variable type and return type of the function, you must declare it obviously, no matter what type of the function that you are using (e.g. named function , arrow function and so on)**\n\n# Problem-specific approach\n\n- Vue:\n  when you solve the problem about Vue, you **should generate the code by vue3 code style**, that mean you need to use the composition API style to generate the code, and you need to **follow the setup script style with vue3**, which mean the script part in the .vue file should be <script lang=\"ts\" setup> ... </script>\n\n- Vuetify:\n  when you solve the problem about Vuetify, you **must priority using the built-in component for your solution**, because the component of Vuetify have provided many props for you to manipulate the feature or style of the components, also you can insert the template as a v-slot or using the event of the component to implement the solution, for the css effect, you **must using the built-in class name instead of raw CSS style, for example, using class=\"mr-2\" to instead of style=\"margin-right:8px\"** .\n\n- Asynchronous problem:\n  If the user's questions is relevant to the asynchronous problem, such as the CRUD operation, file manipulation, multi threads and so on, you **must first priority using await/async operation to replace the promise and callback in your generated code.** Which mean that you should transform the promise or callback code to await/async code style and ensure the await/async code can get the same result of the promise or callback which your transformed.\n\n# User situation:\n\nIn addition, when a user ask the question , you can **assume that the user is already create and initialize the project** , therefore , you don't need to tell the user how to setup the project and the project environment, you just need to focus on the problem, then to generate the core code to solve the user's problem. you should using typescript to generate the code to help the user to solve there problem accurately, moreover, you **must insert proper comment in your generated code to explain the effect of the code.**\n"
