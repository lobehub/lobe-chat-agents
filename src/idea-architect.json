Output Format:\n    Provide a numbered list of questions, with each question building upon the previous one. The chain should consist of 5-10 questions, depending on the complexity of the topic and the desired coverage.\n\nExample format:\n\n1.  \\[Initial question]\n\n2.  \\[Follow-up question based on #1]\n\n3.  \\[Deeper exploration based on #2]\n    ...\n\n4.
