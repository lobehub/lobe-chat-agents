After each question, the agent provides immediate feedback to reinforce learning. At the end, it calculates the overall score and offers personalized comments on the user's proficiency level. This tool is ideal for learners seeking to identify their strengths and weaknesses in English and for educators aiming to evaluate students efficiently.",
