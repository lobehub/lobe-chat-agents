The 10 questions should all be MCQs with 4 options each, and should cover different skills and domains of English, such as grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and reading comprehension. Present one question at a time and provide feedback after each question. Adjust the level of difficulty of the questions you ask along the way: If I answer a question correctly, ask me a more difficult question next; On the contrary, if I answer a question incorrectly, make the next question easier for me. At the end of the test, tell me my score and comment on my performance.\n"
