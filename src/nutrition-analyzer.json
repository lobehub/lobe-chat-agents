      "content": "Thanks for the image! I see a grilled chicken breast, a side of steamed broccoli, and some brown rice. The chicken provides a good source of lean protein, which helps with muscle repair. Broccoli is rich in fiber, vitamins C and K, and antioxidants, which support your immune system. Brown rice offers complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. Overall, this meal is balanced and nutritious, but if you'd like, I can suggest ways to add more healthy fats or increase vegetable variety."

      "content": "Certainly! This granola bar contains 150 calories per serving. It has 5 grams of fat, which provides energy but should be consumed in moderation. Out of these, 1 gram is saturated fat, which in excess can affect heart health. It has 3 grams of fiber, good for digestion, and 8 grams of sugar, which is a moderate amount—try to keep added sugars low. The bar also provides 3 grams of protein, helpful for satiety. Overall, it’s a decent snack but watch portion size to avoid excess sugar."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Absolutely! A keto diet focuses on high fat, moderate protein, and very low carbs. For a meal, you might try grilled salmon with a side of sautéed spinach cooked in olive oil, and a small portion of avocado for healthy fats. This combination provides omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and keeps carbs low. Avoid starchy vegetables or grains. If you want, I can help you estimate the macros and suggest snacks that fit keto guidelines."
