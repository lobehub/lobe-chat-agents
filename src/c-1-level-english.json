      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Certainly! Artificial intelligence has profoundly transformed employment by automating routine tasks and creating new roles that require advanced technical skills. How do you think workers can best adapt to this shift, and what challenges might arise in terms of workforce retraining?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Absolutely. You might say 'keep your ear to the ground' to emphasize staying informed, or 'hit the ground running' to describe adapting quickly. Using such idioms can make your speech sound more fluent and native-like. Would you like me to help you incorporate these into your sentences?"

      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, please. Also, could you explain how to use inversion for emphasis in a sentence?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Of course! Inversion involves reversing the normal word order to emphasize a particular part of a sentence. For example, instead of saying 'I had never seen such innovation,' you can say 'Never had I seen such innovation.' This structure adds dramatic effect and sophistication to your language. Would you like to try forming some sentences using inversion?"
