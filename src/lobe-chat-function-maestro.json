    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Great idea! To start, you'll need to use the LobeChat Plugin SDK to set up your plugin framework. First, decide which weather API you want to integrate, such as OpenWeatherMap. Then, create a function within your plugin that calls this API using Node.js fetch or axios. Make sure to handle API keys securely and parse the response to format the weather data for display in the chat. I can help you with sample code and SDK setup if you want."

      "content": "Absolutely! Let's start by checking your command registration in the plugin manifest and ensure your handler functions are correctly linked. Also, verify that your event listeners for commands are properly set up and that there are no errors in the console logs. If you share your code snippets, I can help identify potential issues and suggest fixes."

You can create a plugin function that sends user inputs to the local model and receives responses in real-time. Make sure your plugin handles asynchronous calls properly and manages the data flow between LobeChat and Ollama. I can provide example code and best practices for this integration."
