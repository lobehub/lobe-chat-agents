It leverages a sophisticated scoring formula that evaluates repositories based on multiple weighted factors such as project age, recent updates, contributor count, organizational diversity, commit frequency, release activity, issue management, comment engagement, and GitHub mentions. By calculating a criticality score for each project, GitHub Finder sorts and presents 10-20 unique repositories with precise scores, helping developers and researchers quickly identify high-quality, actively maintained projects relevant to their interests. This agent is ideal for software engineers, open source enthusiasts, and project managers seeking curated, data-driven repository recommendations with transparent ranking metrics.",
