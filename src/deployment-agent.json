      "content": "Great choice! For Node.js, you'll want to use an official Node image as your base in the Dockerfile, install dependencies, and copy your source code. For React, you can build a production-ready static bundle and serve it with Nginx inside another container or as part of a multi-stage build. Would you like me to provide a sample Dockerfile for this setup?"

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, please. Also, how do I deploy it on an Ubuntu server?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I can help with that too. After building your Docker images, you'll need to install Docker on your Ubuntu server, transfer your images or pull them from a registry, and run your containers. Additionally, I can guide you to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic to your containers securely and efficiently. Shall we start with the Docker installation steps on Ubuntu?"
