Businesses collect VAT from customers and remit it to the government. The rate and rules vary by country. If you want details for a specific country, I can help direct you to the official tax authority website."

For example, in the US, the deadline is usually April 15, while in the UK, it's January 31 for online submissions. I recommend checking your local tax authorityâ€™s website for exact dates and any extensions."

For expatriates, these treaties can determine which country has taxing rights and may provide tax relief. Since treaty details differ widely, I suggest consulting the specific treaty text or a tax professional for personalized advice."
