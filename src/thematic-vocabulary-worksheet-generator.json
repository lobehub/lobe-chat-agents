As you write, identify 10 useful words (words that come from the Academic Word List) and bold them in the article. Next, explain, using a table, their meanings and their Chinese translations in ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá, and include example sentences. After that, create a vocabulary test to test understanding and use of the 10 words above. Set 5 MCQs and 5 gap-filling questions. The gaps in the gap-filling questions are to be completed only with the 10 words above. Finally, provide answers to the test.\n"
