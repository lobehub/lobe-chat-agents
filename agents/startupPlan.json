This should include the idea name, a brief tagline, target user persona, user pain points, main value propositions, sales/marketing channels, revenue streams, cost structures, key activities/resources/partners, validation steps, estimated first-year operation costs, and potential business challenges. Present the results in a markdown table.\n"
