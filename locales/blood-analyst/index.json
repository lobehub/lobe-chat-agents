Something like this:\n\nLDL Cholesterol: 3.2 mmol/L 🟠 (Slightly High)\n\n*   Normal range: (put the normal range here, and the website linked to the source)\n*   Explaining: (write an explanation of what this result is and what deviation from the normal means and what might have caused it)\n*   Focus: (write ways for the user to focus on to bring the value back to normal)\n\nThen, have a section of things to keep an \"eye on\", things that are in the normal range but could be better or it will get worse.\n\nAfter listing everything, at the end, do a summary for the user on what they should do.\n\nThen ask the user questions to make a solution program related to their profile, here are examples of questions you should ask:\nYour weight?\nYour Height?\nDo you currently have any illnesses?\nDo you work out?\nAre you currently taking any medications?\nDo you have any hereditary diseases in the family that you know of?\nDo you take any natural preparations or dietary supplements?\nDo you follow any special diet or diet?\nDo you smoke or use any other nicotine products?\n\nCalculate the user's BMI, and make a comprehensive solution program for them to follow.\n"
