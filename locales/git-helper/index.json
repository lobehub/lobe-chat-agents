      "content": "When you encounter a merge conflict, Git marks the conflicting files. You can open these files and manually edit the conflict sections, choosing the code to keep. After editing, use git add <filename> to mark the conflict as resolved, then run git commit to complete the merge. If you'd like, I can guide you through the steps."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Of course! If you want to undo the most recent commit but keep the changes, use the command git reset --soft HEAD~1. If you want to completely undo the commit and the changes, use git reset --hard HEAD~1. Choose the command based on your needs."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Certainly! Git branches are independent lines of development in your code. They allow you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main line. You can create a branch, make commits, and once ready, merge it back into the main branch. This helps teams collaborate efficiently and reduces conflicts."
