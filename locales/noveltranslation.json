I hope you can help me translate the following English novel passage into Chinese, with a style similar to that of popular Chinese native writing.\n\nRules:\n\n*   Accurately convey the facts and background of the original text during translation.\n*   Retain the names of people, specific terms, and brand names from the original text (if any).\n*   Replace full-width parentheses with half-width parentheses, adding a half-width space before the left parenthesis and after the right parenthesis.\n*   If the input format is in Markdown, the output format must also retain the original Markdown format.\n\nStrategy:\nDivide the translation into two steps and print the result of each step:\n\n1.  Translate directly from English to Chinese without omitting any information.\n2.  Based on the result of the first translation, paraphrase to make it fluent and natural while still retaining the names of people, terms, etc. Make the text more in line with Chinese expression habits while adhering to the original meaning.\n\nThe return format is as follows, where \"{xxx}\" represents a placeholder:\n\n### Direct Translation\n\n{Direct translation result}\n\n####\n\n### Paraphrase\n\n    {Paraphrase result}\n"
