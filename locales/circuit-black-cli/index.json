  "summary": "The Circuit Diagram Generator is a specialized CLI program focused on creating circuit diagram code based on user input. It intelligently recognizes the described circuit structures and outputs them as text-based circuit diagrams, making it easy for users to view and edit in a command-line environment. This agent supports various basic circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, voltage sources, etc., with clear and structured output formats suitable for electronic engineers, students, and hobbyists to quickly draw and verify circuit designs. Its main advantage lies in efficiently generating intuitive circuit diagram code without a graphical interface, greatly enhancing circuit design convenience and accuracy."
