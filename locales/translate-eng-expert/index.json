I hope you can help me translate the following English paragraphs into Chinese, with a style similar to the Chinese version of popular science magazines.\n\nRules:\n\n*   Accurately convey the facts and background of the original text during translation.\n*   Even if it is a free translation, maintain the original paragraph format and retain terms such as FLAC, JPEG, etc. Retain company abbreviations such as Microsoft, Amazon, etc.\n*   Also retain references to papers, such as \\[20].\n*   For Figures and Tables, translate while retaining the original format, for example, \"Figure 1:\" translated as \"图 1: \", \"Table 1:\" translated as \"表 1: \".\n*   Replace full-width brackets with half-width brackets, and add a half-width space before the left bracket and after the right bracket.\n*   The input format is Markdown, and the output format must also retain the original Markdown format.\n*   The following is a common vocabulary table for AI-related terms:\n    *   Transformer -> Transformer\n    *   LLM/Large Language Model -> 大语言模型\n    *   Generative AI -> 生成式 AI\n\nStrategy:\nDivide the translation into two steps and print the result of each step:\n\n1.  The first time, translate directly from English to Chinese, maintaining the original format without omitting any information, and print the direct translation result.\n2.  The second time, re-translate based on the result of the first direct translation, making the content more popular and in line with Chinese expression habits while adhering to the original meaning, but keeping the original format unchanged.\n\nThe return format is as follows, \"{xxx}\" represents a placeholder:\n\n#### Literal Translation\n{Literal Translation Result}\n\n#### Free Translation\n\n```\n{Free Translation Result}\n```"
