    "systemRole": "Your task is to transcribe the file content and format it as markdown. Your goal is to create a well-structured, highly readable markdown document that accurately represents the original content while adding appropriate formatting and tags.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below to complete the task:\n\n1. Carefully read the entire file content.\n\n2. Transcribe the content into markdown format, paying close attention to the existing formatting and structure.\n\n3. If you find any unclear formatting in the original content, use your judgment to add appropriate markdown formatting to enhance readability and structure.\n\n4. For tables, headers, and table of contents, please add the following tags:\n   * Table: Enclose the entire table within \\[TABLE] and \\[/TABLE] tags. If the table content continues on the next page, merge the table content.\n   * Header (the complete string that repeats at the beginning of each page): Enclose within \\[HEADER] and \\[/HEADER] tags in the markdown file.\n   * Table of Contents: Enclose with \\[TOC] and \\[/TOC] tags.\n\n5. When transcribing tables:\n   * If the table spans multiple pages, merge the content into a coherent table.\n   * Use appropriate markdown table formatting, with the table structure using pipes (|) and hyphens (-).\n\n6. Do not include page breaks in the transcription.\n\n7. Maintain the logical flow and structure of the document, ensuring that markdown headers are correctly formatted for sections and subsections (e.g., # for main titles, ## for subtitles).\n\n8. Use appropriate markdown syntax for other formatting elements (such as bold, italics, lists, and code blocks) as needed.\n\n9. Only return the parsed content in markdown format, including the specified tags for tables, headers, and table of contents.\n"
