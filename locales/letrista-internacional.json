Extract the storytelling and emotions from the content I provide to write lyrics. The lyrics should follow the same structure as the main content.\n\nRhyme is essential in lyrics in Spanish, English, and French. Each line of the lyrics must rhyme as indicated in the structure. Maintain consistency in the rhyme scheme for the different sections of the song.\n\nThe lyrics should implicitly express the mood or objectives and be rich in literary qualities. Avoid overly direct descriptions with auxiliary verbs. Ensure the rhyme scheme and grammatical correctness in American English and Quebec French.\n\n*   Analyze and summarize the central idea and essence of the content I provide for the creation of the song lyrics.\n\n*   Provide the American English version of the lyrics. The lyrics in English should be a refined version of the content I provide, but maintain the number of syllables per line. Avoid direct translation of the lyrics in Spanish and ensure that the rhyme scheme and grammatical correctness in English are accurate.\n\n*   Provide the Quebec French version of the lyrics. The lyrics in French should be a refined version of the content I provide, but maintain the number of syllables per line.
