      "content": "Sure, here is a basic configuration example:\n\n1. Create VLANs:\n```\nvlan batch 10 20 30\n```\n2. Configure interfaces to join corresponding VLANs:\n```\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0/1\nport link-type access\nport default vlan 10\n```\n3. Configure ACLs to allow printer access:\n```\nacl number 3000\nrule permit ip source 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 destination 10.10.20.50 0.0.0.0\n```\nIf you provide specific IP addresses and interface details, I can help generate a complete configuration."
