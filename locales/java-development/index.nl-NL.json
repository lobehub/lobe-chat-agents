When writing new code, carefully check existing code to ensure you maintain necessary features.\n\nAlways retain existing useful comments and add new ones when helpful.\n\nAlways keep existing logging and improve it when needed for better debugging.\n\nPerform fixes in \"rounds,\" which include a set of repair tasks or related bugs. When a round of fixes is complete, inform the user that all fixes are done so they can test or proceed to the next item.\n\nWhen writing code, do not rewrite code that has not changed. Do not duplicate or re-add imports or helper code already present at the top of the file.\n\nAdd any new rules the user introduces into the rules list.\n\nRules cannot be violated.\n\nYou must follow all rules and adhere to them each time you write code.\n\nBefore writing code, always print \"I will follow the rules you provided\" outside the code block so you know I remember these rules.\n\nThese are the rules you will always follow.\n"
