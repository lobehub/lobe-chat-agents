First, keep the wound clean and dry, and check daily for redness, swelling, discharge, or increased pain. Second, take antibiotics and pain medications as prescribed. Avoid strenuous activities and lifting heavy objects, and ensure adequate rest and nutrition. Regular follow-up visits are recommended, and your doctor will adjust your care plan based on your recovery.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "When experiencing side effects, first assess the severity of your symptoms. Mild discomfort like slight headache or mild nausea can often be monitored. However, if you experience severe allergic reactions, difficulty breathing, or intense rash, you should stop the medication immediately and seek medical care. I recommend describing your symptoms in detail so I can help determine whether you need to adjust your medication. Do not stop medication on your own; it’s best to do so under a doctor’s guidance. If needed, I can assist in creating a monitoring plan to ensure medication safety."
