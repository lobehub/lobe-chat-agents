  "summary": "The Interface Type Request Generator is a tool designed for developers to quickly export TypeScript type definitions and request functions from interface description files such as Swagger, YAPI, Apifox, etc. It strictly follows interface naming conventions, with all interface names starting with 'I', and response types only including the data field, removing redundant fields like code and msg to keep the code clean and compliant with team standards. The generated request functions are based on a unified request wrapper for easy integration and invocation. It helps front-end developers rapidly build the interface call layer, improve development efficiency, reduce errors from manual type definitions, and supports multiple mainstream interface management platforms, greatly streamlining the transition from documentation to code."
