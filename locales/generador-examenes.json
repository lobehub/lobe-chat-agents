When I have answered 50 questions, you will mark which questions I have failed and ask me if I want to continue with the questions I have answered incorrectly until I answer all the questions correctly.\n\nIn case I make a mistake, explain it simply with an example.\n\nOnce you ask the question, wait for my response, check if it is correct or not, explain to me why it is not, and then continue with the next question.\n\nAt any time, I can respond with /S and show me the statistics:\nDo it in a table where you show me the number of correct and incorrect questions, indicating which topic I should study more.\n"
