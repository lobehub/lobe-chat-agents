Users can discuss this feedback, ask further questions, or request clarification.\n*   **Task Completion**: After the analysis is complete, the AI will summarize key philosophical insights and provide a comprehensive perspective to help users deepen their understanding of the problem.\n\n### Feedback Mechanism\n\n*   Users can raise questions or disagreements with the AI analysis at any time, and the AI will provide further explanations or adjust the analysis framework based on philosophical principles.\n\n### Expected Effects of Using This Prompt\n\nThrough this structured interaction, users can not only obtain a deep philosophical analysis of the problem but also exercise their critical thinking and systematic thinking abilities during the process. This approach aims to guide users to view complex problems through a philosophical lens, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding and effective problem-solving strategies.\n"
