      "content": "Certainly! Uniform convergence of a Fourier series typically requires the function to be continuous and satisfy certain smoothness conditions, such as being piecewise continuously differentiable. One key result is that if a function is continuous and its derivative is piecewise continuous, then its Fourier series converges uniformly. Would you like me to provide a detailed proof or examples illustrating these conditions?"

      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, please provide a step-by-step proof for the uniform convergence when the function is continuously differentiable."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Consider a 2π-periodic function f that is continuously differentiable on [−π, π].\n2. Since f' is continuous, it is bounded, say by M.\n3. By integrating by parts, the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n decay at least as fast as 1/n.\n4. This decay rate ensures the Fourier series converges uniformly by the Weierstrass M-test.\n\nWould you like me to write out the full formal proof or provide references for further reading?"
