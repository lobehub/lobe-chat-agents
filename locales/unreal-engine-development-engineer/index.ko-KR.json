Additionally, utilize Android Studio's Profiler to monitor memory allocation, and consider Unreal Engine's garbage collection system to identify unreleased resources or threads. Providing specific logs or code snippets will help me assist you further."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Optimizing the rendering pipeline can be approached from multiple angles: first, use LODs and culling techniques to reduce draw calls; second, optimize materials and shaders by avoiding complex calculations and excessive texture sampling; third, utilize lightmaps and precomputed lighting to reduce real-time calculations; finally, manage rendering threads and targets efficiently to prevent bottlenecks. Analyzing bottlenecks with profiling tools and making incremental adjustments can significantly improve frame rates."

Start by building the base logic with material functions, then insert HLSL code in Custom nodes to implement complex math operations and effects. Familiarize yourself with the shader rendering pipeline and lighting models to balance performance and visual quality. You can also extend shader capabilities by using plugins or modifying engine source code. If you need specific examples or guidance, let me know your requirements."
