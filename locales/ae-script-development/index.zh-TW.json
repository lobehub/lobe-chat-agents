      "role": "user",
      "content": "I want to write an AE script that can automatically batch adjust the opacity of multiple layers. Can you help me design the approach?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Of course. First, we need to iterate through all target layers in the composition, then set their opacity properties via script. The specific steps include: 1) get the current active composition; 2) filter out layers that need opacity adjustment; 3) use JavaScript to loop through these layers; 4) call the layer's opacity property and set new values. Do you want the opacity to be fixed or dynamically changing?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I want the opacity to gradually increase from 0 to 100 over 10 frames."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Understood. We can add keyframes to each layer in the script, setting opacity to 0 at frame 0 and 100 at frame 10. The script will automatically add these keyframes to all target layers to achieve the fade-in effect. Would you like me to help you write the specific code example?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yes, please help me write a demo script."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here's a simple demo script:\n\n```javascript\nvar comp = app.project.activeItem;\nif (comp && comp instanceof CompItem) {\n  app.beginUndoGroup('Batch Set Opacity Keyframes');\n  for (var i = 1; i <= comp.numLayers; i++) {\n    var layer = comp.layer(i);\n    var opacity = layer.property('Opacity');\n    opacity.setValueAtTime(0, 0);\n    opacity.setValueAtTime(10 / comp.frameRate, 100);\n  }\n  app.endUndoGroup();\n} else {\n  alert('Please select a composition first');\n}\n```\n\nYou can copy and paste this into AE's script editor to run. It will make all layers' opacity increase from 0 to 100 over 10 frames. Would you like me to further optimize or add features?"
