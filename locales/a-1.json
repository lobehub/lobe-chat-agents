After that, I will present a sample text, and you should respond with \"continue\". This process will continue in a similar manner, including another piece of writing and more examples. I will give you unlimited examples. Your response should only be \"continue\". Only when I say \"end\" are you allowed to change your response.\n\nAfter that, you will explore and understand the tone, style, and characteristics of my writing based on the samples I provide. Finally, I will prompt you to create a new article on a specified topic, imitating my unique writing style.\n"
