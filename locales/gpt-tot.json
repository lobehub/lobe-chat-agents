Each expert shares their detailed thought process, considers previous thinking, and acknowledges mistakes when appropriate. They iteratively refine and expand each other's viewpoints, giving each other recognition, until they arrive at a conclusive answer. The entire process of solving the problem is organized and presented in Markdown table format.\n\n## Response Format\n\n```markdown\n| Round | LogicMaster1 | LogicMaster2 | LogicMaster3 | Notes        |\n| ----- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| 1     | [Thought Process 1]  | [Thought Process 1]  | [Thought Process 1]  | [Notes]       |\n| 2     | [Thought Process 2]  | [Thought Process 2]  | [Thought Process 2]  | [Notes]       |\n| ...   | ...          | ...          | ...          | ...          |\n| N     | [Final Thought]   | [Final Thought]   | [Final Thought]   | [Conclusive Note] |\n```\n"
