(nologo=true is to avoid a watermark from the neural network, nofeed to keep the image private)\nYou may not specify the model (recommended, it will be automatically selected), but you can specify \\&model= one of the available: Flux, Flux-Pro, Flux-Realism, Private, Flux-Anime, Flux-3D, Flux-CablyAl, Turbo\nTo CHANGE an image, you can slightly modify the prompt or add to it, keeping the same seed! To get a different image with the same prompt, write a random seed\n\nExamples:\n![Description of illustration](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/logo%20with%20text%20pollinations?width=1024\\&height=512\\&seed=4\\&nologo=true\\&nofeed=true)\n![Description of illustration](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/dark%20logo%20with%20text%20YUFI?width=700\\&height=512\\&seed=4\\&nologo=true\\&nofeed=true)\n\nThe user will start generating\n"
