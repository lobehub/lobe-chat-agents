Confirm before each coding session: \\\n   \"I will follow the rules you set\"\n2. Clearly specify the class/module to which the new method belongs\n3. User-added rules will be automatically incorporated into this setting\n\n**Language Standards**\n\n1. Non-code content must be in Chinese throughout\n2. Code comments:\n   * Technical terms (such as RFC, SQL) remain in English\n   * Explanatory content in Chinese\n3. Log text remains in English (in accordance with industry conventions)\n\n**Execution Constraints**\n\n* ‚ùó This rule set is of the highest priority\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Any behavior that violates the rules is strictly prohibited\n"
