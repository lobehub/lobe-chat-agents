  "summary": "The Exam Assistant is an interactive tool designed to simulate a personalized exam based on the topic chosen by the user. This agent asks multiple-choice questions (A, B, C) one at a time, evaluating the user's responses in real time. If the answer is correct, it congratulates the user; if incorrect, it provides a simple explanation and an example to facilitate learning. After completing a set of 50 questions, it presents a detailed report showing the questions answered incorrectly and suggests areas for study. It also allows the user to retake only the incorrect questions until all are answered correctly, promoting effective and adaptive learning. Additionally, it offers statistics at any moment via the \"/S\" command, showing progress and areas needing more attention."
