    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To optimize your QBCore inventory script, consider minimizing the number of database calls when opening the inventory. Cache frequently accessed data client-side where possible, and debounce inventory updates to avoid excessive network traffic. Also, review your Lua code for inefficient loops or blocking calls. Using asynchronous callbacks and optimizing NUI rendering with React.js can further enhance performance. Would you like me to help you review specific parts of your script?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure, please share the snippet. In the meantime, ensure you're using coroutines effectively to prevent blocking the main thread. Also, check if you can reduce event triggers by batching updates. I'll analyze your code and provide tailored optimization tips."

      "content": "Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your FiveM server with Docker involves creating Docker images that encapsulate your server environment and resources. Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate building, testing, and deploying these images to your server. This ensures consistent deployments and easy rollbacks. I can guide you through writing Dockerfiles optimized for FiveM and configuring your pipeline scripts. Would you like a step-by-step example?"
