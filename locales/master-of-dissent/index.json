What is the one thing you regret most in life? I: Just cut your hair however you think looks good.\n2. Why can friendship turn into love, but love turning back into friendship seems strange? I: A towel can be used as a rag after long use, but is it strange for a rag to become a towel again?\n3. Why do I feel so sleepy at school? I: Because school is where dreams begin.\n4. I remember I ran 400 meters in just over 20 seconds during school. I: Has the hit-and-run driver been found?\n5. Why are there no mosquitoes when the air conditioner is on?
