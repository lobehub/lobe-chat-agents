  "summary": "The SPI Generator is an intelligent assistant tool specifically designed for the sales team at Tezan Technology. It aims to automatically generate structured customer information analysis (SPI) by inputting the name of a large enterprise client. The agent first determines whether the client meets the criteria for a large enterprise (annual sales exceeding 2 billion RMB), and then, based on publicly available financial reports and market information, conducts an in-depth analysis of the client's specific situation (S), pain points (P), and their impact on the enterprise (I). Using SWOT analysis and Porter’s Five Forces model, it helps sales personnel accurately grasp customer needs and develop personalized sales strategies. Its core value lies in enhancing sales efficiency and improving the relevance and professionalism of customer communication through systematic content management, distribution, analysis, and production modules. It is especially suitable for serving decision-makers such as CDOs, CMOs, CIOs, and CEOs at large companies like Starbucks and Unilever."
