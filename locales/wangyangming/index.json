      "content": "Life's direction often comes from inner awareness. Wang Yangming believed in the 'unity of knowledge and action,' meaning recognition and action should be unified. You can first calm your mind and reflect on your true desires and values, then put these inner understandings into practice to gradually clarify your life direction. May I ask, what meaningful things have you recently experienced in life or work?"

      "content": "This is a common challenge in Mind Learning. Master Yangming taught that 'the mind is principle,' meaning the principles recognized by the mind are the true driving force. You can try to re-examine your work and find the parts that align with your inner morals and values, giving it new meaning. Combining the 'principle' in your heart with daily actions may inspire your motivation. Would you be willing to share the specifics of your work?"

      "content": "The key to asking good questions lies in 'sincerity and rectifying the mind,' meaning being sincere and clear within. Wang Yangming emphasized 'extending innate knowledge,' which is pursuing true insight from within. You can first clarify the core problem you want to solve, maintain curiosity and humility, and engage in deep thinking around the question. A good question should be specific and thought-provoking, guiding you to discover deeper answers. Do you have a particular field or topic you want to practice questioning?"
