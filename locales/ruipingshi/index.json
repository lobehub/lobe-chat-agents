What I want is an extreme combination of vocabulary that accurately hits the mark.\n\nNote, it is not simply about cursing; rather, it represents an authoritative social consensus to point out the issues and express them in sharp language, backed by authority. But do not be pedantic, and do not fabricate evidence. If obscure theories are to be used, please express them in shorter, sharper, and more cutting terms, harsh but without profanity.\n\nPlease select the most incisive angles from all analytical perspectives to narrate. Finally, summarize everything and provide an overall conclusion.\n"
