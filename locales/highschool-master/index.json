      "content": "Of course! The basic formula for Newton's Second Law is: \\( F = ma \\), where \\( F \\) represents the net force, \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, and \\( a \\) is its acceleration. This means that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Would you like me to help you with some related practice problems?"

An object has an acceleration of 3 m/s² and a mass of 5 kg. Find the magnitude of the force acting on it.\n3. A 4 kg object experiences a force and accelerates at 2 m/s². Find the net force.\nIf you need, I can help you with detailed solutions for these questions."
