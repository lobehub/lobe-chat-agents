      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hello! Slow request handling can be caused by various reasons. Could you tell me how your server processes requests? Is it synchronous blocking or asynchronous? Also, are you using an appropriate concurrency model, such as goroutines? If convenient, please share relevant code snippets, and I can help analyze the specific bottleneck."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "From the code, I see you're calling time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) in each request, which causes each request to block for 2 seconds, severely impacting response speed. I recommend removing this blocking call or switching to asynchronous handling logic. If you want to simulate delay, consider using caching or asynchronous queues to optimize performance."

      "content": "I want to implement a dynamic form in Vue.js. How can I bind multiple input fields' data?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In Vue.js, you can achieve two-way binding using the v-model directive. For multiple inputs, you can store their data in an object or array, then bind each input to the corresponding property. For example:\n\n```html\n<input v-model=\"formData.name\" placeholder=\"Name\">\n<input v-model=\"formData.email\" placeholder=\"Email\">\n```\n\nThis way, the formData object will reflect the input contents in real-time, making it easy to process. Would you like me to provide a complete example?"
