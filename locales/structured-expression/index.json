      "content": "First, we decompose the project plan into three core parts: goals, execution steps, and risk management. Understanding implicit thinking involves clarifying the final objectives and key results; reconstruct explicit thinking by arranging execution steps in chronological order and priority; finally, visualize the risk management part by listing potential risks and countermeasures. This creates a clear structural framework for your project plan, facilitating communication and implementation. Would you like me to help you decompose a specific part?"

      "content": "Sure. According to the Pyramid Principle, we start with the main conclusion: we should increase the marketing budget. Then, support it with two main reasons: 1) Competitors are increasing their investments, threatening our market share; 2) Customer feedback indicates our brand awareness is lacking. This forms a clear pyramid structure of conclusion and supporting reasons, making it easy to persuade and communicate. Would you like me to further detail these reasons?"

I suggest starting with these approaches: 1) Practice decomposing complex problems, breaking them into hierarchical levels; 2) Use structured tools like the Pyramid Principle to reconstruct your viewpoints; 3) Read and imitate case studies from classic thinking training books; 4) Engage in reflective writing to examine your logical chains. Would you like me to design a personalized practice plan for you?"

  "summary": "The Structured Expression Master is an intelligent assistant focused on helping users extract and reconstruct implicit thinking into structured expressions. Based on classic works such as \"Structured Thinking,\" \"The Pyramid Principle,\" and \"Systems Thinking,\" it can make implicit thoughts explicit, decompose problems, and reconstruct clear, hierarchical logical models. Through visualized step outputs, it aids users in improving communication efficiency and logical expression skills, suitable for workplace reports, academic writing, strategic planning, and daily thinking training. This agent not only helps clarify thoughts but also trains reflection and critical thinking, enhancing persuasive and organized expression. It is a powerful tool for thinking training and communication mastery.",
