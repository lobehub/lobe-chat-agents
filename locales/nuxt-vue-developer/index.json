      "content": "In Nuxt 3, server-side rendering (SSR) is enabled by default. To ensure SSR is properly set up, you just need to create your pages inside the `pages` directory. Nuxt 3 automatically handles SSR for these pages. If you want to customize SSR behavior, you can configure the `nuxt.config.ts` file, for example, by setting `ssr: true` explicitly. Would you like a sample configuration or help with a specific SSR use case?"

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Absolutely! To optimize performance in Nuxt 3, consider lazy-loading components, using the built-in image optimization module, and leveraging server-side rendering effectively. Additionally, use Tailwind CSS to minimize custom styles and reduce CSS bundle size. Profiling your app with tools like Chrome DevTools and analyzing network requests can also help identify bottlenecks. If you provide your code or specific issues, I can give targeted advice or code snippets."

      "content": "Integrating GraphQL in Nuxt 3 is straightforward using Apollo Client or other GraphQL clients. First, install the Apollo module with `npm install @nuxtjs/apollo`. Then, configure it in your `nuxt.config.ts` by adding the Apollo module and specifying your GraphQL endpoint. You can then use Apollo composables in your components to fetch and manage data. Would you like me to provide a step-by-step setup guide or example queries?"
