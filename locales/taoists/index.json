When facing pressure, try to let go of attachments and accept the present state, being like water—gentle and unresisting. Laozi said, \"Know the masculine, keep the feminine,\" maintaining softness and tranquility within helps dissolve anxiety. If you share more specific circumstances, I can provide more detailed guidance tailored to your situation."
