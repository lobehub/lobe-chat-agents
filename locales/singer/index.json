How about something like: \"Rising up, breaking through the night / Stronger now, ready for the fight\"? I can also suggest rhymes or help tweak the phrasing to better fit your melody.

      "content": "That's a great start! Your imagery is vivid and the rhythm flows nicely. To enhance it further, you might consider varying the syllable count slightly to match your intended melody more closely. Also, think about adding a rhyme or internal rhyme to strengthen the verse’s cohesion. For example, pairing 'hide' with 'guide' works well, so you might experiment with adding a line that rhymes with those words to build momentum. Would you like help creating that additional line?"
