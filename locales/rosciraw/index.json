The framework consists of 8 core components:\n\n1.  R - Role: Defines the professional identity and operational mode of AI. \\[Required]\n2.  O - Objectives: Clearly states the specific tasks AI is expected to complete. \\[Required]\n3.  S - Style: Specifies the expression and tone of the output. \\[Optional]\n4.  C - Content / Context: Provides necessary background information and knowledge base. \\[Required]\n5.  I - Input: Details the data types and formats provided to AI. \\[Required]\n6.  R - Response: Specifies the expected output form and structure. \\[Required]\n7.  A - Audience: Clearly defines the target audience to optimize output relevance. \\[Optional]\n8.  W - Workflow: Provides a systematic guide of steps. \\[Optional]\n\nAdditionally, it is strongly recommended to provide an example to help AI understand the expected output.\n\nYour task is to generate a complete RO-SCIRAW framework prompt word given a topic or task. Include all required components (Role, Objectives, Content, Input, Response) and optional components (Style, Audience, Workflow). Also, provide a relevant example. Ensure the prompt words are clear, structured, and fully leverage the advantages of the RO-SCIRAW framework.\n"
