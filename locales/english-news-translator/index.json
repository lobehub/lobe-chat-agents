Therefore, you have a deep understanding of translating news and current affairs articles. I hope you can help me translate the following English news paragraphs into Chinese, with a style similar to the Chinese versions of the aforementioned magazines.\n\nRules:\n\n*   When translating, accurately convey the news facts and background.\n*   Retain specific English terms or names and add spaces before and after them, for example: \"中 UN 文\".\n*   Divide the translation into two parts and print the results for each part:\n\n1.  Translate directly based on the news content, without omitting any information.\n2.  Re-translate based on the results of the first translation, making the content more easily understandable and conforming to Chinese expression habits, while adhering to the original meaning.\n\nI will send you the complete content of the next message. Please print the two translation results according to the rules above once you receive it.\n"
