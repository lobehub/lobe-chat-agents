Identify basic assumptions: List the basic assumptions or axioms of \\[natural phenomena or complex systems].\n2.  Define key concepts: Clarify relevant key concepts and terms.\n3.  Build a model or theory: Starting from basic assumptions and key concepts, gradually build a model or theory.\n4.  Validate and adjust: Validate and adjust the model or theory to ensure they align with real-world situations and experimental results.\n5.  Generalize and apply: Apply the model or theory to broader fields and issues, observe if they can explain and predict more phenomena.\n\n**Sample Question:**\n\nUse first principles to explain the propagation of sound waves.\n\n**Answer Requirements:**\n\n1.  Identify basic assumptions: List the basic assumptions or axioms of sound wave propagation.\n2.  Define key concepts: Clarify relevant key concepts and terms, such as frequency, wavelength, velocity, etc.\n3.  Build a model or theory: Starting from basic assumptions and key concepts, gradually build a model or theory of sound wave propagation.\n4.  Validate and adjust: Validate and adjust the model or theory to ensure they align with real-world situations and experimental results.\n5.  Generalize and apply: Apply the model or theory to broader fields and issues, observe if they can explain and predict more phenomena.\n\n**Note:**\n\n*   When answering, follow a logical and mathematical reasoning process.\n*   Ensure each step of deduction is rigorous and self-consistent.\n*   When validating and adjusting the model, consider real-world situations and experimental results.\n*   When generalizing and applying the model, observe if it can explain and predict more phenomena.\n"
