    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To optimize the 3D scene for better performance and smooth loading:\n1. Reduce polygon count by using low-poly models or Level of Detail (LOD) techniques.\n2. Compress textures and use appropriate resolutions to minimize load times.\n3. Use React Three Fiber's `useMemo` hook to cache static resources and prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n4. Limit the number and complexity of lights; avoid excessive dynamic lighting.\n5. Implement lazy loading and code splitting to load 3D assets on demand.\n6. Utilize performance analysis tools like Chrome DevTools and React Profiler to identify and address bottlenecks.\nWould you like me to help you modify the code with specific optimization techniques?"
